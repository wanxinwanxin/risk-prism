# Design decisions

Decisions made 2026-08-19 at project start. Revisit deliberately; each bump
of `ModelConfig.version` should reference the decision that changed.

## 1. Flagship methodology: fundamental factor model

Barra-style: style + industry factors, cross-sectional regressions, factor
covariance + specific risk. Chosen over statistical (PCA) because
interpretability is the product — agents need to *explain* risk, not just
quantify it. SEC EDGAR's XBRL API makes the fundamentals side free and
public domain, which is what makes an open-source version viable at all.
A statistical model may be added later as a validation baseline.

## 2. Data strategy: hybrid

We publish precomputed model artifacts (exposures, factor covariance,
specific risk — derived data, safe to redistribute) *and* ship the full
pipeline so anyone can rebuild with their own price source. Raw prices are
never redistributed. Fundamentals/SIC: EDGAR (public domain). Prices:
pluggable providers — Yahoo chart API is the keyless default (unofficial
endpoint, redistribution-restricted, hence artifacts-only distribution);
Tiingo with a key; stooq kept but currently behind a JS challenge. Users
must check their provider's terms for their own rebuilds.

## 3. Agent interface: Python package + MCP server

`pip install osrisk` for the math; `osrisk-mcp` for agents. A hosted REST
API was deliberately deferred (hosting cost/ops without proven demand).

## 4. Refresh: weekly GitHub Actions

Cron builds the model weekly and publishes the artifact directory. Weekly
matches the medium-horizon design; daily refresh only matters for
short-horizon/trading use, which is out of scope for v1.

## Defaults adopted without much debate (revisit as needed)

- **Horizon**: medium (weekly returns). Short-horizon daily model = v2 idea.
- **Industries**: Fama-French 12 from SIC codes — public, stable, avoids GICS
  licensing. Coarser than commercial models; acceptable for v1.
- **Point-in-time**: fundamentals use EDGAR `filed` dates (no lookahead), but
  the price panel is a *current* snapshot — delisted names are missing, so
  historical factor returns have survivorship bias. Documented loudly in
  METHODOLOGY; fixing this properly (delisted-price archive) is the single
  biggest v2 data improvement.
- **Universe heuristics**: 1-5 letter tickers, one per CIK (shortest = primary
  class), price/ADV floors. Crude but transparent.
- **Stack**: Python 3.11+, numpy/pandas, parquet. pandas over polars for v1 —
  ubiquity beats speed at this data size; revisit if the pipeline slows.
- **License**: MIT (code). Artifacts: derived data, distributed with
  attribution of sources.
- **Naming**: package `osrisk`, model version string `OSRM-US-MH-x.y`
  (US, Medium Horizon).
